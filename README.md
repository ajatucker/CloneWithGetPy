# CloneWithGetPy
This is a simple tool to quickly collect repositories for research and collect commit data. 
Prior to using, you should have collected all the project names and urls in a csv file. 

Note: You need to update the clone_repo_path and the files being fed into the tool at this time. I have noted the places that need to be updated for your convenience.
